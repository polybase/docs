title: Gateway API Overview
---

The Polybase Gateway REST API provides a convinent way to access the Polybase decentralized network.

<Warning>
While the Polybase network is in Alpha, the gateway is the only way to access the Polybase network. We will shortly be adding p2p access to the network.

## Authentication

The Polybase Gatweay API uses public/private key pair for authentication. That means it works natively with wallets like Metamask.

Authentication is composed of:

 - `v` the version being used, should be `v=0` 
 - `t` current unix timestamp in seconds
 - `h` type of hash signing being used `eth-personal-sign` is currently the only allowed option
 - `sig` the signature of the data 


An example of a valid authroization:

```
v=0,t=1671884992,h=eth-personal-sign,sig=0x288db6271d92253ae19983a8e5110f1bc1bef1911210127ccbf657d85428ba9917aa9457f0f8e7f300a36b106525d3a3471e63ae265af4898742040a377e1da11c
```

The token is passed in the `X-Polybase-Signature` header of the request.
