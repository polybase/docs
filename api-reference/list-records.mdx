<RequestExample>

```bash Bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://testnet.polybase.xyz/v0/collections/polybase%2Fcore%2Fusers/records\
     --header 'Accept: application/json'
```

</RequestExample>

## Path Params

<ParamField path="collection_path" type="string" required>
  The path to the collection holding the record. This must be URL encoded, so a collection path of `polybase/core/users` would be requested as `polybase%2Fcore%2Fusers`.
</ParamField>


## Query Params

<ParamField query="where" type="json">
  A JSON object which defines a filter to be applied to the list of records returned. 
  
  For simple equality based filters you can use the `<field>:<value>` format, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "polybase",
  "rating": 5
}
```

Additional filter operators can be applied using the format: `<field>:{ [operator]: <value> }`, where operator can be one of the following:

  - `$gt` to match values greather than the value provided
  - `$lt` to match values less than the value provided
  - `$gte` to match values greater than or equal to the value provided
  - `$lte` to match values less than or equal to the value provided
  - `$eq` to match values exactly equal to value provided

For example:

```json
{
  "name": { "$gte": "polybase" },
  "rating": { "$gt": 4  }
}
```

<Note>
It is recommended to provide the JSON object value in a minifed format such as: `?where={"name":"polybase"}`
</Note>

</ParamField>

<ParamField query="sort" type="array">
  A JSON array in the format `[string, "asc"|"desc"][]` which defines the sort order for the returned records.
  
For example, to sort by name (ascending) and age (descending) you would use the following filter.

```json
[["name", "asc"], ["age", "desc"]]
```

<Note>
It is recommended to provide the JSON array value in a minifed format such as: `?sort=[["name","asc"]]
</Note>

</ParamField>

<ParamField query="limit" type="number" default={100}>
  Limit the number of returned records. By default, 100 records are returned.
</ParamField>


<ParamField query="cursor" type="string">
  The cursor for the next set of records that should be returned when pagingating through a list of records.

  You can take the cursor value from the `cursor` property of the response object.

  ```json
{
  "data": [ ...record data ],
  "cursor": {
    "before": "AgFQEiAR3bqAGG4qimQ10/cIBQc4txP8JvMFtq4NmblXSbnFPAIAAQAVAAQwMDAxLTAxLTAxVDAwOjAwOjAwWgsABENvbGxlY3Rpb24=",
    "after": "AgFQEiAR3bqAGG4qimQ10/cIBQc4txP8JvMFtq4NmblXSbnFPAIAAQACAAgAFgAEZGVtby9zb2NpYWwvZm9sbG93ZXJz"
  }
}
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="since" type="number">
  Wait for changes since a given timestamp (for up to 60 seconds), useful for watching for changes in the data. 
  After your first request, you should use the response timestamp returned in the `X-Polybase-Timestamp` header as the value for `since`.
</ParamField>
